# The Mojito

My most up to date Mojito recipe.

# Ingredients/Equipment

* 25ml Lime Juice
* 25ml Simple Syrup (1:1 Sugar/Water)
* 50ml White Rum
* 1 Palmful of Mint Leaves
* Crushed Ice to taste
* Soda Water to taste (optional)
* High Ball Glass

## Method

Into the glass, put the mint (slightly crushed to release the oils) first - followed by the crushed ice, lime juice, simple syrup and white rum, then stir.

Top up with soda water (optional) to taste, depending on desired strength.

## Notes

**Using a 1:1 ratio of sugar to water in the Simple Syrup gives an overall 1:1:2 ratio of Lime Juice:Simple Syrup:White Rum, easy to remember.**
**Slapping the mint leaves between palms does a good job of releasing the essential oils and flavour needed, without need for a muddler.**
